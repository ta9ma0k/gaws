## Project Overview

This is a GitHub Actions sandbox repository (gaws) used for testing GitHub Actions workflows and configurations. The repository is currently minimal with only basic documentation.

## Repository Structure

- `README.md` - Basic project description in Japanese
- Currently no workflow files or GitHub Actions configurations present

## Development Notes

This appears to be a testing/experimental repository for GitHub Actions. When working with this codebase:

- GitHub Actions workflows would typically be placed in `.github/workflows/` directory
- Test configurations and example workflows may be added as the repository develops
- The project description indicates this is for GitHub Actions testing ("Github Actionsのテスト用ディレクトリ")
